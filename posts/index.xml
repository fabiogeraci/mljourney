This enables developer to reduce infostructres costs as well as opening the door for edge deployment.</description></item><item><title>Negative Samples Dilemma In Object Detection</title><link>https://fabiogeraci.github.io/mljourney/posts/first-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiogeraci.github.io/mljourney/posts/first-blog/</guid><description>Table Of Contents 🔥 Motivation 🔫 Why 🔩 What are negative samples? 🩺 The Other Side 🙏 Comments &amp;amp; Feedback Follow me 👇 🔥 Motivation Link to heading This is the dilemma that every machine learning practitioners have faced it while working on object detection problem. In this blog, I will share my thoughts, in order to help new engineers in making the correct choices when they are setting up the dataset pipeline.</description></item></channel></rss>
