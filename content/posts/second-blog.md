## üî• Motivation:

- As architecture get more complex, for improved prediction results, the generated model are larger and larger, therefore the need to reduce their size and allow the model to run prediction on CPU. This enables developer to reduce infostructres costs as well as opening the door for edge deployment.

## üî´ What:

- I used a blood cells photos, originally open sourced by [cosmicad](https://github.com/cosmicad/dataset), downloaded from Roboflow Universe (bccd dataset).

## üöí Why:

- I am true beliver that Science and Technology should be used for the benefit of the many, the Medical Industry is and will benefit greatly from all the AI/ML application in development.

## ‚õ≥ How:

- In this post, I show you how you can supercharge your YOLOv5 inference performance running on CPUs using free and open-source tools by Neural Magic.

## üî© Setting Up

I followed the excellent blog [Supercharging YOLOv5](https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/supercharging_yolov5_180_fps_cpu/) from [Dickson Noah](https://dicksonneoh.com/)

## Table Resume Prediction Speed

The table below clearly shows that the Yolov5n Pruned+Quant average FPS is 2.5 times faster than the standard YOLOv5s, and
roughly double respect Yolov5s Pruned+Quant, almost equaling the performance of its gpu counterpart.
