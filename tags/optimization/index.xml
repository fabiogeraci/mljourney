As architecture get more complex, for improved prediction results, the generated model are larger and larger, therefore the need to reduce their size and allow the model to run prediction on CPU. This enables developer to reduce infostructres costs as well as opening the door for edge deployment. What:
I used a blood cells photos, originally open sourced by cosmicad, downloaded from Roboflow Universe (bccd dataset). Why:
I am true beliver that Science and Technology should be used for the benefit of the many, the Medical Industry is and will benefit greatly from all the AI/ML application in development.</description></item></channel></rss>
